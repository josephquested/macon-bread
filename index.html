      I love BREAD! I know that life can be difficult -
      my practice has taught how to face these difficulties
      and find not only the strength to bear them but also how
      to face fully all of life’s experiences, from the joyful
      to the mundane. I know the value of a consistent practice, and I am honoured
      to share this with you. <br><br> I found bread while living in San Francisco,
      and have been fortunate enough to study with incredibly kind and
      intelligent bakers. I bring a compassionate and encouraging presence
      to my bread, and aim to make my bread relevant and meaningful to everybody.
